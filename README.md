Overview
This project is designed to demonstrate a secure authentication system using JWT in a MERN stack environment. JWT provides a stateless authentication mechanism where the user's session is stored in the form of a digitally signed token, which can be securely transmitted between the client and server.

The project provides a basic setup for user registration, login, and protected routes. Upon successful authentication, the user receives a JWT token which is then used to access protected routes. The backend server verifies the token for each protected request, ensuring that only authenticated users can access the protected resources.

Features
User registration with validation
User login with JWT authentication
Protected routes accessible only with a valid JWT token
Password hashing for enhanced security
Logout functionality to invalidate the JWT token
